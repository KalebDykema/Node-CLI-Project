# Node-CLI-Project
This is a project I've created to learn how to built a CLI with Node.js.

This was largely based off of [this tutorial.](https://www.twilio.com/blog/how-to-build-a-cli-with-node-js)

## To Use
1. Run ```npm link```
2. You can then run ```create-project``` along with various options.
